# ChatSuite Environment Configuration - Quick Reference

## 🎯 Problem Solved
- **Before**: `pnpm start` always used `host` environment, ignoring `.env` file
- **After**: `pnpm start` respects the environment set in `.env` file

## 🔧 Key Commands

### Environment Management
```bash
pnpm env:show        # Check current environment
pnpm env:set:dev     # Set to development environment  
pnpm env:set:qa      # Set to QA environment
pnpm env:set:host    # Set to host environment
pnpm env:test        # Run comprehensive configuration test
```

### Starting Services
```bash
pnpm start                    # 🆕 Uses environment from .env file
pnpm start:workspace:dev      # Force development environment
pnpm start:workspace:qa       # Force QA environment  
pnpm start:workspace:host     # Force host environment
```

## 📁 How It Works

1. **Root `.env` file** controls default environment:
   ```
   # .env
   NX_APP_ENV=dev
   ```

2. **Environment-specific configs** in `config/env/`:
   ```
   config/env/.env.dev    # Development settings
   config/env/.env.qa     # QA settings  
   config/env/.env.host   # Host settings
   ```

3. **Docker Compose** uses the resolved environment:
   ```yaml
   env_file:
     - ./config/env/.env.${NX_APP_ENV:-dev}
   ```

## ✅ What Changed

- ✅ `pnpm start` now respects `.env` file (was hardcoded to `host`)
- ✅ Added environment management commands
- ✅ All NX commands load `.env` automatically
- ✅ Explicit environment overrides still work
- ✅ Comprehensive test suite included

## 🚀 Usage Examples

**Typical Developer Workflow:**
```bash
# Set your preferred environment once
pnpm env:set:dev

# Start services (uses dev environment)
pnpm start

# Check what environment you're using
pnpm env:show
```

**Override for Testing:**
```bash
# Your .env is set to 'dev', but you want to test QA
pnpm start:workspace:qa  # Temporarily uses QA environment
```

**Environment Switch:**
```bash
# Switch to QA for extended testing
pnpm env:set:qa
pnpm start  # Now uses QA environment
```
