# Security Policy

Thank you for taking security seriously. This document explains how to report
security vulnerabilities responsibly for ChatSuite and what to expect after you
report.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in ChatSuite, please report it
privately to the maintainers so we can respond and remediate safely.

- Preferred: Send an email to `hubertus@hubertusbecker.com` with:

  - A concise summary of the issue
  - Affected components and versions (if applicable)
  - Steps to reproduce, PoC, or sample code
  - Any suggested mitigations or patches

- If you prefer encrypted email, include a PGP-encrypted message. (Maintain the
  PGP public key here if you publish one.)

Do NOT open a public issue for a security vulnerability unless you cannot
reach the maintainers or unless the vulnerability has already been fixed and
public disclosure is intended.

## Response Timeline

- Acknowledge receipt: within 72 hours.
- Triage and initial assessment: within 7 days.
- Remediation plan and follow-up: within 30 days (timeline may vary by severity).

We will keep you updated on progress and coordinate disclosure timing. If you
require confidentiality beyond email, include that request in your initial
message.

## Public Disclosure

We follow coordinated disclosure practices. We will not disclose reported issues
publicly until a fix is available or until a mutually agreed disclosure date.
We welcome authorship credit on advisories when appropriate.

## Supported Versions

Security fixes are generally provided for the current release and the previous
stable release. If you are unsure which versions are supported, include the
version information when reporting.

## Safe Harbor

We welcome and appreciate responsible disclosure. We will not initiate legal
action against individuals acting in good faith to report security issues in
accordance with this policy.

Thank you — we appreciate your help keeping ChatSuite secure.
